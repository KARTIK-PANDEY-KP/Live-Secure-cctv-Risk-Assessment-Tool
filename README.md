# LiveSecure  

## üöÄ Inspiration  
The idea for LiveSecure stemmed from recognizing the untapped potential of live CCTV footage. Existing systems rely heavily on manual monitoring or static object detection models, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic situations. We aimed to create an AI-powered system that transforms CCTV feeds into real-time actionable insights for individuals, businesses, and travelers‚Äîsolving security, real estate, insurance, and travel safety challenges.  

## üîç What It Does  
LiveSecure is a versatile platform that serves multiple purposes:
